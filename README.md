 <li>Implement the linear regression algorithm to estimate the weight parameters for the feature matrix (X) and the class label vector (y). You can use batch gradient descent algorithm for the implementation. (a) Plot the cost function vs the number of iterations. (b) Plot the cost function (J) vs w1 and w2 in a contour or 3D surf graph (w= [w0 w1 w2]). Please use the dataset “data.xlsx”. (Use for or while loop for the implementation)</li>
